# Grammar Error Detection and Correction â€” Machine Learning Domain
# Project Overview
This project aims to develop an intelligent grammar error detection and correction system leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques within the machine learning domain. Currently, it employs a rule-based grammar checking engine (LanguageTool) for accurate corrections and is designed for future integration with machine learning models to enhance context-aware grammar correction.

The application supports both direct text input and document uploads (PDF, DOCX, TXT) via an interactive web interface built with Gradio, making it accessible and easy to use.

# Features
Rule-based grammar error detection with LanguageTool

Support for text input and multi-format file uploads

Download corrected documents as Word files

Summarizes grammar issues found

Modular architecture to incorporate ML models in future phases

# Future Work and Machine Learning Integration
Collect and preprocess annotated grammar error datasets

Train supervised machine learning models (e.g., Transformers) for context-aware corrections

Combine rule-based and ML approaches to improve accuracy

Expand language support beyond English

Enhance real-time correction and collaboration features
